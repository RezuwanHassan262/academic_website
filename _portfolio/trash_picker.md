The **TrashPicker Bot** is an advanced Arduino-based robot designed to autonomously locate, detect, and collect trash.  

### Key Features:
- **Navigation:** The bot is capable of moving to specific coordinates to locate trash.  
- **Detection and Sorting:** Equipped with deep learning capabilities, the bot utilizes the **YOLOv8 model** to detect and classify trash for sorting.  
- **Trash Pickup Mechanism:** A **stepper motor** powers the trash-picking mechanism, enabling precise and efficient operation.  

This project combines robotics and AI to provide an effective solution for automated waste management.
