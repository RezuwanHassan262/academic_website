Tuberculosis (TB) poses global health challenges, requiring efficient management and monitoring of patients undergoing Directly Observed Therapy (DOT). This paper introduces TB-meds, a proposed software application to automate essential aspects of TB patient management. TB-meds aims to optimize resource utilization, improve patient care, and enhance TB control efforts. The application streamlines medication distribution, facilitates medication adherence monitoring, sends timely clinical test requirement's notifications, and enables convenient treatment status updates. By automating these processes, TB-meds has the potential to enhance efficiency, improve treatment outcomes, and reduce transmission rates. Its user-friendly interface promotes seamless communication among healthcare providers and TB patients. With tasks automation, the workload of DOT providers can be reduced, and more time can be dedicated to patient education, nutrition counseling, and lifestyle guidance. Additionally, TB-meds proposes to revolutionize TB surveillance by enhancing data collection and analysis capabilities, enabling informed decision-making and targeted interventions. The implementation of TB-meds holds promise for transforming TB patient management, contributing to better health outcomes, and advancing TB control efforts.
