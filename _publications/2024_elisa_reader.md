Viral diseases pose a significant public health challenge in developing countries, where resources for accurate diagnostic testing are often limited. The reliance on less accurate qualitative diagnostic tests, such as Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs), can lead to frequent misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment, exacerbating the burden of these diseases on affected populations. In Bangladesh, where access to more accurate quantitative diagnostic tests like the Enzyme-Linked Immunosor-bent Assay (ELISA) is scarce due to cost and availability constraints, there is a critical need for innovative solutions to improve diagnostic accuracy while reducing testing costs. This paper introduces a Reduced Cost ELISA Reader designed by leveraging inexpensive materials and innovative design principles, that submits a cost-effective solution for precise viral disease diagnosis. Clinical evaluation demonstrates 95.39% accuracy and 93.33% sensitivity, positioning this device as a promising tool for improving healthcare outcomes in low-resource settings.
