As Bangladesh’s e-commerce landscape evolves, the roles of social media and websites in shaping buyers’ behavior have become essential to understand, especially given the growth of online shopping. This study examines these platforms’ distinct affordances and limitations for Bangladeshi buyers and sellers, asking how they impact buyers’ online shopping decisions and experiences. Through qualitative methods, including in-depth interviews and surveys, this research analyzes buyers’ and sellers’ preferences, behaviors, and perceptions of trust, accessibility, and cultural relevance across these digital spaces. Findings reveal that social media fosters engagement, accessibility, and direct interaction, resembling traditional shopping experiences for many buyers. However, trust and security issues make websites preferable for their structured and reliable shopping interfaces. This study suggests that a dual-platform strategy, where social media is used to drive engagement and websites establish credibility, can strengthen online shopping in emerging markets such as Bangladesh. These results contribute to the existing research by highlighting the intersection of digital infrastructure, trust, and engagement in influencing buyer behavior in low-resource settings, with implications for e-commerce development. Future research may explore how platform-specific strategies impact longer-term buyer trust and market growth, providing additional insights into optimizing digital platforms for diverse user needs in emerging economies.
