This is a C compiler designed to compile basic C syntax (excluding structs and pointers).  

- **Lexical Analysis:** Implemented using **Flex**.  
- **Semantic Analysis:** Handled using **Bison**.  
- **Parse Tree:** A parse tree is generated during the compilation process.  
- **Output:** The compiler produces **x86 machine instructions** as the final output.  

This project demonstrates the core principles of compiler design, from parsing to code generation.
