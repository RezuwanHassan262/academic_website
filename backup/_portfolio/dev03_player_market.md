This desktop application facilitates player transfers between clubs. Clubs can list their players on the market for sale, and once a player is purchased, notifications are sent to other clubs. Interested clubs can submit purchase requests, which are then relayed to the original club for approval. 

The app includes features to display detailed player information and statistics, robust search functionality, and an interactive interface with graphs and charts. Additionally, the codebase adheres to standard coding practices and employs design patterns for maintainability and scalability.
