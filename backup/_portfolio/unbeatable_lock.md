The door locking system incorporates multiple security features, including **RFID**, **password authentication**, and **voice recognition**.  

### Key Features:
- **Password Protection:**  
  - If the password is entered incorrectly more than three times, the system automatically calls the owner.  

- **Anti-Tampering Mechanism:**  
  - A laser-based security feature is added to block the lock and prevent unauthorized access in case of tampering attempts.  

This multi-layered system ensures enhanced security and proactive responses to potential threats.
