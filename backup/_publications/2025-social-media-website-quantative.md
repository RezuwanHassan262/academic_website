Social media and websites have emerged as the dominant platforms for online shopping, each catering to distinct user preferences. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine both buyer and seller preferences between these platforms and the underlying reasons for their choices in the context of Bangladesh. We have surveyed 105 participants through live interviews and Google forms, including 20 sellers who are also buyers. We have used Cramér’s V test, network analysis, and frequency analysis to analyze the associations of different factors. Our findings suggest that while websites remain the preferred shopping platform, the ease of use and intuitive interface of social media play a critical role in maintaining its relevance. Additionally, social media is an effective tool for building trust, shaping customer behavior, and establishing market presence. These insights offer online sellers valuable guidance on tailoring their strategies to maximize platform effectiveness.
